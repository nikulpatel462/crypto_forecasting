# Kaggle Crypto Competition
Repository for my Kaggle G-Research crypto forecasting submission: https://www.kaggle.com/c/g-research-crypto-forecasting

Includes the Python library I created to help with investigating the given dataset and for fitting models and the notebooks I created to document my research process and the ideas I had.

This hasn't formally been submitted since it would have taken me too much time to adapt the final model to the competition's submission rules, but I'd be happy for someone to wrap this up for me (as long as the credit is shared...).

If there is any feedback on the notebooks or code please let me know. I'm aware there are rough edges in the code that could be improved with more time and effort - I cut this short since I wanted to work on other things.
