# Kaggle Crypto Competition
This is a repository for my Kaggle G-Research crypto forecasting submission (https://www.kaggle.com/c/g-research-crypto-forecasting).

Includes the Python library I created for investigating cryptocurrency data and fitting models, and the notebooks I created to document my research process.

If you have any suggestions for improvements or feedback on the notebooks or code please let me know (nikulp68@gmail.com).
